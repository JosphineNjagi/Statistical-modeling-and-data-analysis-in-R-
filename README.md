Identifying key predictors of global life expectancy using multiple linear regression, PCA, and exploratory data analysis

Overview
Life expectancy serves as a critical indicator of population health and societal well-being. Multiple factors influence an individual's ability to live longer, including access to quality healthcare, nutrition, education, economic conditions, and disease prevention measures.
With global health disparities and varying mortality rates across different regions, understanding the key determinants of life expectancy has become increasingly important for policymakers, healthcare professionals, and researchers.
This comprehensive analysis examines the relationship between various socioeconomic, health, and demographic factors and their impact on life expectancy outcomes. Using statistical modeling and data-driven approaches, this study aims to identify the most significant predictors of life expectancy and provide actionable insights for improving population health outcomes.
Key Objectives

Identify the most significant predictors of life expectancy
Quantify the relationship between various health, economic, and social factors
Develop optimized predictive models through systematic variable selection
Provide evidence-based insights for policy interventions

Methodology
Data Source
